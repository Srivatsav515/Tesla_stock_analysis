## Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook `Tesla_stock_analysis.ipynb` contains the following analysis:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the CSV dataset, handle missing values, and perform any necessary data cleaning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the stock data to understand trends, patterns, and key metrics such as opening price, closing price, trading volume, etc.
3. **Stock Price Prediction**: Develop a machine learning model to predict future Tesla stock prices based on historical data.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations like line plots, candlestick charts, and other relevant graphs to better understand the stock performance.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then open the `Tesla_stock_analysis.ipynb` file and execute the code cells.

Make sure to download the CSV dataset and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
